Compiler Instructions

- Please provide a checklist for your circle. 
	- This can be plain text, Excel or a PDF.
	- It does not have to be in any particular sort order.
	- Preferred name: {circle-code}-{year}-checklist.pdf , e.g. CASJ-2022-checklist.pdf
	
- A plain text file with species that require a writeup
	- Preferred name: {circle-code}-2022-Rarities.txt , e.g. CACR-2022-Rarities.txt

Sector Leader Instructions

Please send the compiler the eBird name of anyone who is filing a checklist for the count.
This is needed so we can distinguish people officially on the count from other birders
also birding on count day. 

In addition when submitting the checklist, indicate the number of people in the party (through eBird),
and promptly share the list with others. This allows us to automatically capture party members.


IMPORTANT NOTE: I forgot to mention this before, but the program works by
counting submitted checklists that intersect with the count circle. This could
include people not officially doing the count. I shouldn’t double count, since I
notice if two checklist for the same area are filed (I take the MAX species
count). If you send me a list of participants (can be everyone or just the ones
who submitted official eBird lists), I will filter out other reports.

SEEING SPECIES TOTAL
Looks like a total of 122 species were reported across all sectors. To see that, do the following:
- in the Total column of the CACR-CountCircleSummary.xlsx file, filter and uncheck ‘0’
- in the Category column, set it so that only ’species’ is checked
- Select the shown entries in one column, e.g. Total. I selected from Snow Goose to Western Tanager, then I see “Count: 122” in the lower right corner
