The parameters/SystemParameters directory contains "global" translations, i.e. those
that are common to most systems. Hopefully, these should not have to be modified.

Note that Rare_Bird_Form_fillable.pdf is a copy of the NAS form found here:
	https://www.audubon.org/sites/default/files/cbc_rare_bird_form.pdf
It has then been turned into a fillable PDF using Adobe Acrobat. Do not replace this
without performing a similar step.
